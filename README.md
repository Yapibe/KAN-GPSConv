# KAN-GPSConv

This project explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers and their integration into Graph Positional Signatures (GPS) networks.

## Project Goals

- Implement GPS networks with KAN layer integration.
- Evaluate performance on benchmark datasets.
- Compare expressiveness, interpretability, and performance with standard GPS networks.
- Summarize relevant research in KAN and GNN.

## Directory Structure

- `data/` - Contains the benchmark datasets.
- `models/` - Stores model architectures and configurations.
- `experiments/` - Includes experiment scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
- `results/` - Stores results from model evaluation, including metrics and visualizations.
- `utils/` - Contains helper functions, such as data loaders and preprocessing scripts.
- `literature_review/` - Documents and papers related to KAN and GNN research.

## Setup

1. Create and activate the Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create --file environment.yml
   conda activate kan-gpsconv
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   conda install --file requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Experiments

TBD: Instructions on how to run the experiments.
